# _futureCrop model_
Developed by [**Peter Skelsey**](mailto:peter.skelsey@hutton.ac.uk?subject=futureCrop), James Hutton Institute, Dundee

## Basic overview
A desktop app for performing climate change risk assessments in real crop locations in Great Britain:
* Upload your own data.
* Train, tune, and test regression- or classification-tree ensembles in a few easy clicks, and save your results.
* Choose a raster distribution of crop species to apply your model in.
* Select a future time-period and season.
* Hit the run button, visualise the projected values, and save them to create your own graphics. 

## Example
The example regression dataset included with the app was used to train, tune, and test regression tree ensembles using a nested k-fold cross validation procedure with Bayesian optimization for tuning of hyperparameters. The most accurate predictive algorithm was an ensemble of boosted regression trees. The results can be saved to your PC.

Once your model is defined in the Model Tab, you can move on to the Projections Tab. in this example, barley has been selected as the crop distribution and the results panel shows boxplots of projected values for the the 2030s - 2060s.

## Motivation
This app was developed as a tool to help non-modellers access cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and perform state-of-the-art climate change risk assessments. At your fingertips are real crop / land-use data from [IACS](https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/direct-support/iacs_en) and [JACS](https://www.gov.scot/collections/june-scottish-agricultural-census/), and [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) spatially and temporally coherent probabilistic climate change data (emissions scenario RCP8.5). 

### Installation and loading
Due to the many controls and features of the app, the GUI is a fixed size and not 'responsive,' i.e. it will not scale to fit the screen of your device. However, the GUI is small enough that it should be suitable for notebooks etc. with smaller screens. To download the files, click on the green 'Code' button near the top of the screen and then on 'Download ZIP'. Extract the files and double click 'futureCrop.exe'. This will open a web-based installer that will download 'MATLAB Runtime' to your computer (if required). MATLAB Runtime is a royalty-free standalone set of shared libraries that enables the execution of compiled MATLAB applications on computers that do not have MATLAB installed. Once this is installed you will be able to use thousands of MATLAB apps for free, including this one. If you already have the correct version of MATLAB Runtime then this step will be skipped. After installation the app will load using the shortcuts provided. When the app is loading a splash screen will appear then disappear and there will be a short interval (~5 seconds) before the app loads; there is no need to try and load it again, just be patient. Note: if you do not want to download the example data files and app documentation, you can click on 'futureCrop.exe' above, then download and install as described.

### Documentation
A full guide on how to use the app to perform climate change risk assessments is provided in the [Documentation.md](https://github.com/pskelsey/futureCrop/blob/master/docs/Documentation.md)
